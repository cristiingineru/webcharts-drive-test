        <h1>Webcharts: Death Stranding Trailer Song (Low Roar - I'll keep coming)</h1>

        <p> 0 is the second album of Icelandic band Low Roar, released in 2014. The fourth song and the second song on the album, "I'll Keep Coming" and "Easy Way Out", 
            became well known in 2016 when it was featured as the trailer music for Hideo Kojima's video game project Death Stranding in addition to an episode of Killjoys.
        </p>
        <p> Death Stranding is an upcoming open world action video game developed by Kojima Productions and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. 
            It is the first game by game director Hideo Kojima and his company following the 2015 disbandment of Kojima Productions as a subsidiary of Konami and subsequent reformation 
            as an independent studio, and was officially announced at Sony's E3 2016 conference. The game will be released sometime prior to 2019.

            According to Kojima, one of the key aspects of the announcement trailer was the idea of a connection between life and death.
             Kojima explained one of the game's main themes through a short story by Kōbō Abe, in which Abe says that the first tool created by humans was a stick, 
             meant as protection by putting a distance between oneself and "bad things", and that the second tool was a rope, which is used to secure things one finds important. 
             Kojima compared the main "tools" in action games – punching, shooting and kicking – to sticks, and said that in Death Stranding he wants people to communicate through the game equivalent of ropes

            The title refers to the phenomenon of cetacean stranding, whereby whales and other cetaceans are washed up on shore; "strand" also stands for strings and connections. 
            The Schwarzschild radius and Dirac equation – relating to the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics – appeared on dog tags worn by Reedus's character in the teaser.
